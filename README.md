<p>
Now that the ticketing system is set up I start by configuring some roles. First, I go to the admin panel to create an agent with the role of Supreme Admin that has full permissions. We are now going to configure Departments and create a "SysAdmins" department within our ticketing system.

<h2>Configure teams</h2>

<p>
Next we configure Teams to add an online banking team to the ticketing system and add an agent to it.
</p>
<br />

<h2>Add agents and SLAs</h2>

<p>
Now we'll add two random agents Jane and John doe to be a part of our new departments Sysadmins and Support. The agent panel is the next destination so that we can create two random users as well to create tickets in our ticketing system. Lastly, we'll create three simple SLA's Sev A,B, and C and some common help topics that we could experience in our ticketing system.
